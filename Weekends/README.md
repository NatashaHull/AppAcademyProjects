Weekend Projects and Assessment Prep
===================================
This folder contains the weekend projects I worked on (which were often the result of online tutorials) as well as the assessment prep folder for the 5 App Academy assessments on Ruby, more Ruby, SQL, Rails, and JavaScript.

#Word Chains
In the main weekends directory, there is also code for a word chains search algorithm that uses A* search to try and find the fastest word chain between any two words of the same length. The code I wrote first uses the associated dictionary to create a graph of words, each of which has a list of related words. This code can be found [here](https://github.com/NatashaHull/AppAcademyProjects/blob/master/Weekends/w1_word_chains.rb) The actual effectiveness of the word chains code remains untested because my computer ran out of memory just after creating the word graph that can be used for word chains and did not run the search algorithm itself.
