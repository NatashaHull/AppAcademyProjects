Follower App/Authentication Practice Project
==============================
This is an application that I programmed in under 2 hours which has all the basic features of authentication as well as a handful of features relevant for following other users.

The prompt to create this app was the following:

* Profile page
  * Should see a list of people user is following and people who
    are following that user.
  * Profile page should be protected so only that user can see his/her
    own list of followers and followees.
* Sign-up
  * Should submit a name, username, and password on sign-up and have
    it create a new user
* Sign-in
  * Make a SessionsController
  * Submit username and password on sign-in
* FollowingsController
  * Should see a list of all users with buttons to follow
  * Follow buttons should not be shown for people the user is
    already following. Instead, show unfollow button.
