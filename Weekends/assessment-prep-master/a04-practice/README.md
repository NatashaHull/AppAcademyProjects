# Assessment 4 - practice

# Notes
When the specs are clicking on links, they're expecting to go to the edit, or show pages for the link objects, not to the destination url of the object.


# Instructions
This assessment will focus on a simple CRUD app with authentication.

You will have to model users, links, and comments, along with session
management.

The specs all test high-level functionality in your app. Take a look at
them as you go to ensure you are naming your links, buttons, and routes
correctly.

Good luck!

## Database Config
Every time you run `rake db:migrate` run `rake db:test:prepare`.
