# Jasmine Test Framework

Jasmine is a JavaScript unit test framework that is modeled on Ruby's
RSpec test framework. You can check out [Jasmine's docs][jasmine-docs]
which are really nice.

Take a look at the spec files (in the `spec` folder) and the actual
files with the code (in the `src` folder). Your assessment tomorrow will
use the same folder structure.

To run the specs, simply open up the `SpecRunner.html` file in your
browser.
