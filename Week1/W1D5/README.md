Trees and DFS and BFS
====================

Each of these projects involves traversing a tree using either depth-first search or breadth-first search. While almost of of the code was written by Chris Evans and myself. The Tic Tac Toe game code is taken from a solution that neither of us wrote. Additionally, I spent hours debugging the Tic Tac Toe AI after working with Chris.
