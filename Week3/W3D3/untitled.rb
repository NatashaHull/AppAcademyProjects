# # Associations Quiz
#
# Write `User`, `Course`, `Enrollment` models. Write associations so I
# can write:
#
# ```ruby
# enrollment.user
# enrollment.course
#
# user.enrollments
# user.enrolled_courses
#
# course.enrollments
# course.enrolled_students
#
# # allow a course to have a single pre-requisite course.
# course.prerequisite
#
# # a user teaches a course
# course.instructor
# ```
#
# When done **have your TA come over and check your work**.
