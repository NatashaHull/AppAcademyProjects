99 Cats
========
#Description
99 Cats is a cat version (without css) of 99 Dresses. This application has dynamically generated HTML forms for renting cats as well as basic authentication with the possibility of logging in on multiple places and logging out of specific locations.

#Collaborators
This was the result of a two day project with different partners. The first day (where my partner and I dynamically generated forms for renting cats) I worked with Jen Hamon. The second day (where my partner and I added authentication to the prior day's word in addition to allowing users to see where else they're logged in) I worked with Joshua Foster.
